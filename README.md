Seminar Project topic Email Spam/Ham detection using machine learning.
The Email Spam-Ham Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify email messages as either spam (unwanted, often malicious content) or ham (legitimate, desired content). The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of labeled emails, distinguishing between spam and ham.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the email text by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing normalization techniques such as stemming or lemmatization.
3. Feature Extraction: Convert the email text into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings.
4. Model Training: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) on the preprocessed data to learn patterns associated with spam and ham emails.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the most effective model.
6. Deployment: Implement the chosen model into a system that can automatically filter incoming emails, classifying them as spam or ham in real-time.

The project's goal is to improve email security and user experience by effectively filtering out unwanted spam emails while ensuring legitimate emails are correctly identified.
